We (Stanford&#x2F;UCSD ExCamera) are using AWS Lambda to do massively parallel low-latency video encoding with 4,000+ concurrent threads. Our colleagues at U.C. Berkeley who built PyWren are doing machine learning on Lambda with similar numbers of threads. AWS has been encouraging to us for these kind of workloads, even if they aren&#x27;t what Amazon initially envisioned.<p>So a hard limit of 400 (that can&#x27;t be increased) would be a real bummer.

AWS Lambda lets you write your code in Node.js, Python, Java, or C#.  This is particularly useful for tuning your Lambdas based on their expected usage.  If you have a Lambda that is being constantly invoked, it might be better to write it in Java.  It has a longer start up time but has better performance after the initial startup.  However, if your Lambda is invoked infrequently (and thus is frequently shutdown from inactivity), it would better to write it in Node.js or Python to take advantage of the snappier start up time.","comments":[{"id":13832677,"user":"mbleigh","time":1489088767,"time_ago":"2 years ago","type":"comment","content":"<p>Firebase engineer here.<p>Additional languages will come, but we&#x27;re starting with Node.js.

Cloud Functions lets you extend an existing service with custom code. The best example is Cloud Storage and thumbnailing. If you wanted to automatically create thumbnails for images you could do that easily with an endpoint on app engine. The only problem is you&#x27;d lose out on all the other features that Cloud Storage for Firebase offers like automatic resume and 3p authorization. Instead you could write a Cloud Function that creates thumbnails as a side effect and your client app keeps talking directly to a BaaS.","comments":[],"comments_count":0,"level":1,"url":"item?id=13832048"},{"id":13832027,"user":"habosa","time":1489086267,"time_ago":"2 years ago","type":"comment","content":"<p>It&#x27;s a pretty different model, so not really an apples-to-apples comparison.
